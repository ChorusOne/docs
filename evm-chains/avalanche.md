### 1. Create an account

If you've spent some time reading how Avalanche works, you'd know that staking on Avalanche works a bit differently. First, you need an Avalanche Wallet. Create a new one or access your [existing wallet here](https://wallet.avax.network)&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you're on the right URL. Don't fall prey to phishing attacks by sites that look like the official wallet
{% endhint %}

{% embed url="https://wallet.avax.network" %}
Avalanche Wallet
{% endembed %}

### 2. Purchase some AVAX

Once you've accessed your wallet, you need some $AVAX! If you bought your AVAX on an exchange, you'll need to transfer it to the `X-chain`. Copy your `X-chain` address and use it to withdraw your AVAX from the exchange.

### 3. Cross Chain Transfer

You should now have some AVAX on the X-chain. But staking works with the P-chain so you need to use the "Cross Chain" feature to move your AVAX from the X to the P-chain. You will need to pay a small amount of AVAX as fees so make sure you don't transfer the entire amount.

### 4. Select Chorus One Node

Once your AVAX is on the P-chain, it's time to stake! Click **`EARN`** on the left-hand side of the menu.

Since you want to delegate your AVAX, click on `DELEGATE` and then `ADD DELEGATOR`. Now you want to choose the Node you're delegating to. In order to delegate to the [@ChorusOne](https://twitter.com/ChorusOne) node, copy the below <mark style="color:blue;">`NodeID-LkDLSLrAW1E7Sga1zng17L1AqrtkyWTGg`</mark> Go to `Search Node ID` and paste it there. Click `Select`. You're almost there!

### 5. Confirm Delegation

Select the end date for your stake, the amount for staking and click on `Confirm`. That's it. Congratulations. Your AVAX will now start earning rewards and you've just made the network more secure. If this AVAX staking guide helped you, share it with a friend!

{% hint style="info" %}
The minimum staking duration is two weeks. A delegator will receive a higher percentage of rewards if they decide to stake for longer amounts (up to a year), thus incentivizing longer stake lengths.

## How to stake

### 1. Create or Restore Phantom Wallet

Navigate to [https://phantom.app/](https://phantom.app) to create or restore your Solana wallet.

#### Creating the wallet <a href="#creating-the-wallet" id="creating-the-wallet"></a>

If you do not have a wallet yet, you should create a new wallet and note down the seed phrase and store it in a safe place. Follow the onscreen instructions and make sure to fund your wallet with some SOL tokens before you proceed with staking

![Create a new wallet or restore an old one](../.gitbook/assets/create\_wallet.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to not **share** or **lose** the secret recovery phrase (mnemonic)
{% endhint %}

#### Restoring the wallet

If you already have a wallet, you can restore it on Phantom using the associated seed phrase. Follow the online instructions to restore your SOL account.

![Enter the recovery phrase (mnemonic)](../.gitbook/assets/restore.png)

Once you entered the 12 or 24 words you can then restore your wallet and optionally set a password on your account.

### 3. Stake

Once logged in, you will be able to view all the SPL assets that you possess. If you do not already have SOL tokens you can get them from a friend or buy them off-exchange and transfer those to your wallet.

Once you do that you will be able to see the SOL tokens in your wallet.&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (88).png>)

Go ahead and click your SOL balance and on the top right, you will see 3 dots. Click the dots to reveal the staking menu. Click the menu-item `Stake SOL`

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (49).png>)

You will be shown a list of validators along with a search button. Go ahead and type `Chorus One` in the search panel. **Chorus One's** validator will show up. Go ahead and click on the validator name.

Choose the amount of SOL you would like to stake and click on `Stake`

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to leave some SOL in your account to pay for the transaction fees
{% endhint %}

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (89).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (92).png>)

Once you click `Stake` you will immediately see that your wallet is staking your SOL to your chosen validator. You can also click on the `View Transaction` link to see the status of your transaction in a blockexplorer. If you look at the Confirmations field you can slowly see it increasing from 0 to 32. Once it reaches the MAX number of confirmations your transaction gets added to the blockchain

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to note down the transaction hash or the link provided on the screen. This allows for easier debugging in case of a failed transaction.
{% endhint %}

After your transaction is successful you can go back to your Phantom wallet, click on the Solana balance, and see your **stake accounts.**&#x20;

> **Congratulations! You are now staking your SOL!**

If you click on your stake accounts you will see that your stake is activating. It takes 1 epoch for your stake to activate. An epoch in Solana lasts for approximately 2-3 days. After this period your stake will show up as active and will start earning rewards.

## **How to u**nstake

If you click on your stake balance, you will be given the option to unstake. Unstaking also takes an epoch. Once you click `Unstake` your stake will start **deactivating** and will become fully **inactive** after a maximum of 3 days (1 epoch).

After the stake become inactive you can withdraw it back to your Solana account

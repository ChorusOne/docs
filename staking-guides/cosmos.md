The Cosmos Hub seeks to become the center of a network of blockchains abiding by the standards of the [Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC).](https://chorus.one/networks/cosmos/) Cosmos technologies like Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK framework are used by projects like Binance Chain, Band, Terra, Kava, Aragon, and others - securing multiple billions of dollars in value. By delegating ATOM to Cosmos Hub validators like Chorus One, stakers receive a share of inflationary token rewards, as well as fees from transactions that go through the Hub, for example for routing tokens between two IBC-compatible blockchains.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Back up your mnemonic seed securely.**&#x20;

* Anyone with your mnemonic seed can take your assets.&#x20;
* Lost mnemonic seed can't be recovered.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is a 21-day unbonding process for staked ATOMs during which delegator ATOMs do not earn rewards and cannot be transferred, exchanged, or spent. ATOMs can, however, be slashed during the unbonding period.

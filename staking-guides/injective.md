# Injective

## About

The Injective Chain is a layer-2 sidechain and Cosmos Zone connected to Ethereum. Injective supports permissionless trading on arbitrary derivative markets, allowing individuals to create and trade on any derivative market of their choosing. The Injective protocol is implemented on top of Tendermint using the Cosmos-SDK which hosts Injective's decentralized order-book and trade execution coordinator.

## How to Delegate <a href="#8662" id="8662"></a>

### 1. Connect Your Wallet <a href="#8662" id="8662"></a>

Click on `Metamask` and complete the signature request by clicking **Sign**. This will enable you to access the dashboard dapp, where you will be able to view validators and delegate your INJ tokens to them.

### 2. Pre-stake your ERC-20 INJ Tokens <a href="#6fff" id="6fff"></a>

Staking allows INJ holders to delegate their tokens to active validators and share part of the rewards obtained by the validator as a part of the Proof of Stake consensus. Specifically, It allows native token holders to take part in the consensus process without running a validator themselves.

The first step to staking your INJ on the Equinox testnet is to pre-stake your INJ on Ethereum. During this step, your INJ tokens will be locked on Ethereum for 7 days and you will receive an equivalent amount of INJ tokens on the Kovan Ethereum testnet which you can then transfer to the Injective Chain.

Click `Stake` from the header.

Kava is a cross-chain, decentralized finance project focused on providing collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin borrowing for assets from different blockchains. Kava is making use of interoperability solutions to bring its services to tokens like [Binanceâ€™s BNB and Bitcoin](https://www.kava.io/overview).&#x20;

Users of the Kava CDP system earn KAVA tokens and can delegate them to validators like Chorus One, which maintains and govern the protocol with the goal to create a stable platform for cross-chain decentralized finance.

Please note that the unstake period is 21 days. This means that you can only unstake and withdraw coins to your wallet after this time has passed. We wish you profitable staking!

### 4. Stake your KAVA

If you don't already have KAVA in your account fund it with some tokens. You may use an exchange to transfer the KAVA tokens to your address or get it from someone who already holds those.

To stake click on the Kava network in the left panel and click on `Stake`&#x20;

## How to stake $ROSE

A reliable way to stake and delegate your ROSE is using RockX.

### 1. Create/Sign in to your Account

Go to [RockX Wallet for Oasis Network](https://oasis-wallet.rockx.com).

If you do not have an account yet, create one and fund it from either an exchange or get some ROSE tokens from someone who already holds them.

When you create a new wallet you will be shown 24-word mnemonic that you must **securely store!**&#x20;

If you already have an account and you use Ledger then connect your Ledger and follow the instructions.

### 2. Open 'staking' tab

Once you are connected, select the ‘STAKING’ tab.

Find Chorus One among the list of validators and click `DELEGATE` in that row. The validators are sorted by their staking power. You can also see what commission they take on the staking rewards you earn, as well as how many people already delegate tokens to them.&#x20;

The Secret Network is focused on facilitating privacy-preserving smart contracts (secret contracts) to be used in decentralized finance, healthcare, [gaming](https://holdem.enigma.co), and other use cases. The project evolved from the former Enigma community and launched its Cosmos SDK-based blockchain in February 2020.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please note that the unstake period is 21 days. This means that you can only unstake and withdraw coins to your wallet after this time has passed. We wish you profitable staking!

In case you do not have an existing Keplr account you can create a new account

{% hint style="info" %}
You will be shown 12 words as your mnemonic seed. Select`24 words` option for a more secure mnemonic. _Back it up securely (read the warning below)_
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Back up your mnemonic seed securely.**&#x20;

* Anyone with your mnemonic seed can take your assets.&#x20;
* Lost mnemonic seed can't be recovered.

Enter an account name and a passphrase to unlock your wallet. You will be asked for the mnemonic again. Enter the 24 words in order. This is to make sure you remember the mnemonic.

### 3. Log in to your account

Regardless of whether you already have an account or if you created it just now you may now click on the extension to view your address or visit [https://wallet.keplr.app/#/secret/stake](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/secret/stake) to see the full dashboard

### 4. Stake your `SCRT`

If you don't already have `SCRT` in your account fund it with some tokens. You may use an exchange to transfer the SCRT tokens to your address or get it from someone who already holds those.

To stake click on the Secret network in the left panel and click on `Stake`&#x20;

![](../.gitbook/assets/1-stake.png)

You will be shown a list of validators with whom to stake on the right side. Scroll to **Chorus One** and click on `Manage.`

![](../.gitbook/assets/2-validator.png)

A modal with Chorus One's description will pop up. Click once on `Delegate` to enter the amount of tokens you want to stake.&#x20;

![](../.gitbook/assets/3-delegate-1.png)

Clicking on Delegate again will take you to `Keplr` wallet for approval. Approve the transaction and you will be able to see your stake.

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is a 21-day unbonding process for staked SCRT tokens during which delegator SCRTs do not earn rewards and cannot be transferred, exchanged, or spent. SCRTs can, however, be slashed during the unbonding period.
{% endhint %}

# Juno

## Overview

In this tutorial, we will learn how to stake Juno to Chorus One. This will earn you rewards and help to secure the Juno network.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For users with a Juno stakedrop allocation, you will need to add your Juno wallet associated with the stakedrop to your Keplr browser extension.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Delegation of your tokens to a validator will make them unusable for any other purpose. The tokens become "bonded". To "unbond" your tokens, you will need to un-delegate them. This process takes **28 days**. During this unbonding time, you **will NOT receive rewards**.
{% endhint %}

### 1. Login with Keplr browser extension

Open your preferred browser and navigate to [https://juno.omniflix.co](http://juno.omniflix.co). If this is the first time you have visited the UI, you will be shown a splash screen prompting you to connect your Keplr wallet.

Be sure that you have the wallet you wish to use selected by clicking the Keplr icon in your browser toolbar, selecting the silhouette in the top right of the Keplr window and then selecting the account you wish to use.
{% endhint %}

Click the `Connect with Keplr` **button** to continue. A popup window will appear requesting to connect juno.omniflix.co  to your Keplr wallet

### 2. Select a validator and stake your Juno tokens <a href="#select-a-validator-and-stake-your-juno-tokens" id="select-a-validator-and-stake-your-juno-tokens"></a>

To see all the available validators, click the `Stake` **** tab at the top of the page. A list of active validators will be shown, to see more validators you can click the pagination arrows at the bottom of the page. To delegate tokens to your desired validator, click the `DELEGATE` **** button to the right hand side of the row for the validator you wish to delegate too.

A form will appear, showing the validator and a field to enter the amount of tokens to delegate. Your available tokens can be seen at the bottom of the form. Enter the amount of tokens you wish to delegate and click **DELEGATE**.

A Keplr wallet popup will appear asking for approval for the transaction. Click **Approve** to finalize the delegation.

After the transaction is completed, a popup will indicate that the tokens were successfully delegated. Click **DONE** to continue.

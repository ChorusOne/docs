Osmosis is a heterogeneous, interoperable AMM that gives users and LPs flexibility and customization never before seen in existing AMM protocols. LPs can select their time horizons for providing liquidity, third-parties can incentivize pools ad-hoc, governance can distribute OSMO rewards where they deem fit, pool creators can play with mathematical expressions (curves) for lower-slippage swapping and users can swap assets, cross-chain.

Osmosis uses the standard DPoS staking mechanism found in the Cosmos SDK. Users can delegate their OSMO tokens to Chorus One to receive a share of rewards generated by the network.

Please note that the unstake period is 21 days. This means that you can only unstake and withdraw coins to your wallet after this time has passed. We wish you profitable staking!

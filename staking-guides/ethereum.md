# Ethereum

## Overview

Ethereum is the home of most blockchain applications including a wide variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Ethereum launched as a Proof-of-Work network but is migrating to Proof-of-Stake for efficiency and scalability reasons.

By staking ETH, you are able to earn interest on your Ether and participate in the migration to what will be the potentially largest network running on Proof-of-Stake to which all applications currently running on the Ethereum chain will eventually migrate. Visit [Lido Finance](https://lido.fi) to stake with us and to learn more about Lido's staking solution.

## How to stake

{% hint style="info" %}
Metamask allows you to use a hardware wallet such as a `Ledger Nano` device for your staking operations and is highly encouraged as it adds another layer of security. In case you are going to use a Ledger, make sure `Contract data` is allowed. You can allow `Contract data` in the settings within the Ethereum app on your Ledger device.
{% endhint %}

1. Install the latest version of Metamask browser extension and fund it with enough ETH to stake as well as cover the gas fee.
2. Make sure Metamask is connected to `Ethereum Mainnet` network
3. In case you want to use a hardware device for your staking operations, connect Metamask to your device via the Metamask Browser Extension.
4. Visit [https://stake.lido.fi/](https://stake.lido.fi) and click `Connect Wallet`
5. A pop-up will prompt you to select your preferred wallet. Choose `Metamask`. You might have to unlock Metamask with your password in case it is locked.
6. You are now presented with the main menu of the Lido UI. You can find some FAQs at the bottom of the page, make sure to read them to learn more about Lido and the risks involved in using it.
7. You can always click on your account icon in the upper right corner of the UI to disconnect your account, copy its’ address, or explore it on Etherscan.
8. Within the Lido UI, enter the amount of ETH you want to stake and click on `Submit`&#x20;
9. Confirm the transaction in the Metamask pop-up window. In case you are using a Ledger device, check and sign the transaction on your ledger.
10. A confirmation pop-up shows you the success of your transaction as well as your new “staked ETH” balance.

Congratulations, you are now officially staking on Ethereum 2.0s’ Beacon Chain via Lido and are contributing to the security and decentralization of the network!

## Using your Staked ETH

One benefit of using Lido is that it allows you to transfer, trade, and use your staked ETH while your ETH remains locked and illiquid until phase 1.5 of Ethereum 2.0s’ phased rollout.

To make use of this, you need to add `staked ETH` to your Metamask Browser Extension. Open Metamask, click `Add Token`, and then switch to the `Custom Token` tab. Input the following information, click `Next` and then `Add Tokens`.

```
Contract address: 0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84
Decimals: 18
```

You can find `staked ETH` in the `Assets` tab on Metamask. You can then head over to the ecosystem section on the Lido page and explore the various DeFi integrations where stETH can earn additional rewards

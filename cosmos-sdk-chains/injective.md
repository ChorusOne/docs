# Injective

## Overview

Injective is an open, interoperable, layer-1 blockchain built for finance applications.

It provides a powerful smart contracts platform tailored for DeFi developers to build and launch dApps for widespread use quickly. Injective uniquely provides traditional finance infrastructures, such as an order book module, on-chain, and is highly interoperable with prominent layer 1s, including Ethereum and Cosmos.

## How to stake <a href="#8662" id="8662"></a>

### 1. Access the Hub <a href="#8662" id="8662"></a>

We will stake via the Injective Hub. Go to [https://hub.injective.network/](https://hub.injective.network/) and click on `Connect` on the top-right corner to connect with any wallet currently integrated with Injective, which currently includes [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/), [Cosmostation](https://www.cosmostation.io/), [Leap](https://www.leapwallet.io/), [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/), [Torus](https://blog.injective.com/injective-integrates-torus-wallet-to-enable-social-logins-for-mainstream-users/), or [Trezor](https://blog.injective.com/injective-becomes-the-first-cosmos-ecosystem-blockchain-to-integrate-trezor-to-further-hardware-wallet-support/) wallet.

### 2. Explore the dashboard

Once you get connected you can view your dashboard. On the top right, you can view and copy your INJ address and the equivalent address in Ethereum. The `Disconnect` option is also found here.

On the dashboard, you can click on `Delegate Now` to view validators and delegate your INJ tokens to them.

Search for `Chorus One` in the search box and click on `Delegate Now`

A popup window will appear, and you can specify the amount of INJ you wish to stake.

Click on `Delegate` and you will be asked to sign a transaction, which will take place entirely on the Injective Chain. This means you no longer need to pay high gas fees!

Congratulations! You've successfully delegated your INJ tokens. You can head back to the **Wallet** page to view your delegations.

### 4. Claiming rewards and unbonding

You claim your rewards, distributed continuously every block, on the **Wallet** page. When you unbond your tokens, you will stop receiving rewards, and your original INJ balance will be returned to you after the unbonding period, which is 21 days. The unbonding period can be changed via community-based governance.

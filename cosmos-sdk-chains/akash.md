Akash is a decentralized marketplace, where cloud providers (providers) can lease their computing power to users (tenants). The Akash marketplace functions by conducting reverse auctions whereby the tenant creates orders for computing power, and providers bid on these orders. When the tenant chooses a provider, they create a lease. After this, the user deploys a Docker container on the Akash Container Platform where users are able to then run any cloud-native application and access a range of cloud management services like Kubernetes.

Please note that the unstake period is 21 days. This means that you can only unstake and withdraw coins to your wallet after this time has passed. We wish you profitable staking!

### 4. Stake your `AKT`

If you don't already have `AKT` in your account fund it with some tokens. You may use an exchange to transfer the AKT tokens to your address or get it from someone who already holds those.

To stake click on the Akash network in the left panel and click on `Stake`&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/1-stake (1).png>)

You will be shown a list of validators with whom to stake on the right side. Scroll to **Chorus One** and click on `Manage.`

![Click on Manage](../.gitbook/assets/2-manage.png)

A modal with Chorus One's description will pop up. Click once on `Delegate` to enter the amount of tokens you want to stake.&#x20;

![Delegate to Chorus One](<../.gitbook/assets/3-delegate-1 (1).png>)

Clicking on Delegate again will take you to `Keplr` wallet for approval. Approve the transaction and you will be able to see your stake.

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is a 21-day unbonding process for staked AKTs during which delegator AKTs do not earn rewards and cannot be transferred, exchanged, or spent. AKTs can, however, be slashed during the unbonding period.

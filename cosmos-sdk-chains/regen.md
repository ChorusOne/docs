Regen Network uses blockchain to solve problems seldom-found in carbon credit marketplaces now of double-counted carbon credits and unaccountable parties not enduring penalties for not following protocol. Regen Network has opted to use Cosmos SDK to build a blockchain that is able to track the provenance of carbon credit issuance and exchange.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please note that the unstake period is 21 days. This means that you can only unstake and withdraw coins to your wallet after this time has passed. We wish you profitable staking!

### 4. Stake your `REGEN`

If you don't already have `REGEN` in your account fund it with some tokens. You may use an exchange to transfer the REGEN tokens to your address or get it from someone who already holds those.

To stake click on the Regen network in the left panel and click on `Stake`&#x20;

![](../.gitbook/assets/stake.png)

You will be shown a list of validators with whom to stake on the right side. Scroll to **Chorus One** and click on `Manage.`

![](../.gitbook/assets/validator.png)

A modal with Chorus One's description will pop up. Click once on `Delegate` to enter the amount of tokens you want to stake.&#x20;

Clicking on Delegate again will take you to `Keplr` wallet for approval. Approve the transaction and you will be able to see your stake.

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is a 21-day unbonding process for staked REGENs during which delegator REGENs do not earn rewards and cannot be transferred, exchanged, or spent. REGENs can, however, be slashed during the unbonding period.
{% endhint %}

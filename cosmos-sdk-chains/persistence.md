Persistence acts as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). Using Persistence, non-native crypto institutions can easily participate in the DeFi ecosystem for better access to financing and crypto-native DeFi investors get a better selection of yields. Persistence is building a full suite of financial products for institutional and native crypto users alike that will eventually intertwine and blur the lines between traditional finance and DeFi.

Please note that the unstake period is 21 days. This means that you can only unstake and withdraw coins to your wallet after this time has passed. We wish you profitable staking!

### 4. Stake your `XPRT`

If you don't already have XPRT in your account fund it with some tokens. You may use an exchange to transfer the XPRT tokens to your address or get it from someone who already holds those.

To stake click on the Persistence network in the left panel and click on `Stake`&#x20;

You will be shown a list of validators with whom to stake on the right side. Scroll to **Chorus One** and click on `Manage.`

A modal with Chorus One's description will pop up. Click once on `Delegate` to enter the amount of tokens you want to stake.&#x20;

Clicking on Delegate again will take you to `Keplr` wallet for approval. Approve the transaction and you will be able to see your stake.

There is a 21-day unbonding process for staked XPRTs during which delegator XPRTs do not earn rewards and cannot be transferred, exchanged, or spent. XPRTs can, however, be slashed during the unbonding period.
